The method used to calculate the maximum depth of a binary tree does not strictly adhere to the typical in-order, pre-order, or post-order traversals. However, if we must categorize it, it most closely resembles a post-order traversal.

Here's why:

In-order traversal visits nodes in the order: left child, current node, right child.
Pre-order traversal visits nodes in the order: current node, left child, right child.
Post-order traversal visits nodes in the order: left child, right child, current node.
In the maxDepth function, the process is as follows:

Recursively calculate the depth of the left subtree (maxDepth(root.left)).
Recursively calculate the depth of the right subtree (maxDepth(root.right)).
Use the depths calculated from the left and right subtrees to calculate the depth of the current node (Math.max(leftDepth, rightDepth) + 1).
This process aligns with post-order traversal because the current node (root) is processed after the recursive calls to its left and right children have been made, which is the defining characteristic of post-order traversal.
