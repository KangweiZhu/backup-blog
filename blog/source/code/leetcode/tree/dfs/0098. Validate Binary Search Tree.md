### Recursive Validation Process

#### Initial Call

- Start with `validate(root, Long.MIN_VALUE, Long.MAX_VALUE)`
  - `root` is `5`, so the initial bounds are `(Long.MIN_VALUE, Long.MAX_VALUE)`, meaning `5` can be any value within this range.

#### Validate Node 5 (Root)

- **Left Child of 5**: Validate `3` with bounds `(Long.MIN_VALUE, 5)`
  - `3` is valid since it is within the bounds.
- **Right Child of 5**: Validate `7` with bounds `(5, Long.MAX_VALUE)`
  - `7` is valid since it is within the bounds.

#### Validate Node 3

- **Left Child of 3**: Validate `2` with bounds `(Long.MIN_VALUE, 3)`
  - `2` is valid since it is within the bounds.
- **Right Child of 3**: Validate `4` with bounds `(3, 5)`
  - `4` is valid since it is within the bounds.

#### Validate Node 2

- **Left Child of 2**: Validate `1` with bounds `(Long.MIN_VALUE, 2)`
  - `1` is valid since it is within the bounds.
- **2 has no right child.**

#### Validate Node 1

- **1 has no children.**
  - Checks complete for this path.

#### Validate Node 4

- **4 has no children.**
  - Checks complete for this path.

#### Validate Node 7

- **7 has no left child.**
- **Right Child of 7**: Validate `8` with bounds `(7, Long.MAX_VALUE)`
  - `8` is valid since it is within the bounds.

#### Validate Node 8

- **8 has no children.**
  - Checks complete for this path.

### Summary of Bounds Update

This example demonstrates how the bounds are updated at each step to enforce the BST properties:

- As we move to a left child, the current node's value becomes the new maximum bound for that subtree.
- As we move to a right child, the current node's value becomes the new minimum bound for that subtree.
- In every recursive call, the subtree is checked against these updated bounds, ensuring that each node adheres to the rule: all nodes in the left subtree must have lesser values, and all nodes in the right subtree must have greater values than the current node. This process validates the entire tree's structure, confirming it as a valid BST.
