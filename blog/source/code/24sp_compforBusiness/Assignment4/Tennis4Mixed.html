            Mixed Doubles (or “XD”) has a long history in tennis with the first grand slam mixed match being played at
            the
            1887 US Open Championships. It was also included as an event in the Olympics in 1900, 1912, 1920, and 1924
            but
            was excluded from the Olympics held between 1925 and 2011. However, in 2012, XD was included again as an
            event
            at the London Olympics and was also included as an event at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics and the 2020
            Tokyo
            Olympics. It is also now included as an event at each of the four grand slam tournaments (Australian Open,
            French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open).

        Doubles Rules</a>
    <br>
    In general, tennis mixed doubles rules are the same as for regular doubles. Serving rules are the same, as each
    player (both male or female) serves until a game is won or lost. Each player will serve to both players in the
    opposing team, and vice versa. Scoring rules are generally the same, with a 10-point tiebreaker as the deciding set.
