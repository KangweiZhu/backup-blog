            The scoring rules in doubles are similar to those of singles. When your team wins a point, you are awarded
            “15,
            30, 40, and game.” In most tournaments including on the professional tour, doubles is usually played with
            no-ad
            scoring. This means that the point at deuce is sudden death, and the receiving team gets to choose the side
            they
            want to play it on. You will want to be sure to discuss whether you and your friends are playing “no-ad
            scoring”
            or “regular scoring” before you start playing. Besides that small difference, the set is played the same way
            in
            doubles and singles. Teams play up to 6 games. If the score reaches 5-all, teams will play 2 more games. If
            the
            score is 6-all, you will play a tiebreaker. If the score reaches 7-5, the set is complete.

        tennis doubles</a>
    <br>Communication is important between partners during a doubles game – if one player hits a weaker shot then the
    other needs to be aware so that they can adjust accordingly and put pressure on the opposing team’s weaknesses.
